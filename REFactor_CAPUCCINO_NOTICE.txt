Project Sync â€” Capuccino (Automated Deep Refactor)
This archive was produced by an automated transformation requested by the user.
What changed (best-effort):
- Replaced occurrences of 'mocha' and 'mocca' with 'capuccino' (case variants).
- Moved frontend from 'src/main/resources/app' -> 'src/main/resources/static/app' so Spring Boot serves assets.
- Ensured Bootstrap CDN links are present in HTML files under the app folder.
- Replaced common Spanish UI words with English equivalents (basic set).
- Updated pom.xml artifactId/name where detected to reference 'capuccino'.
- All visible strings were attempted to be translated to English where common terms were found.
Caveats:
- This is an automated refactor. Java package names and deep code logic were left mostly intact to reduce compile errors,
  but textual replacements may still require manual review.
- Please run `mvn clean package` and test the app locally. Some manual fixes may be required.
If you want, I can now:
1) Run a deeper refactor (rename Java packages and classes) and try to keep project buildable.
2) Run a Maven build here and report compilation errors so we can iteratively fix them.
3) Further translate remaining Spanish phrases manually if you point them out.
